Daylin - 2-5 min short stop motion film. Teenage girl, city, relationship b/t
audience and characters in that time. Contrasting tones of blue/orange, dif
lighting, similar to Coraline. Stop motion puppets/set. Reading Stop-motion
Animation book, borrowed by M. Shroegen. Wood armature, clay hands w/epoxy puddy,
foam head, bead eyes like Coraline. Armature wires. Skin - smooth, realistic.
Helped by scultper/anatomy sister. Gowned woman, wandering city streets, blue lights,
warmer oranges rise from underneath, identicle stop motion puppet greets her. She's
accepting a new rebirthed version of herself. Will document process. Wooden table,
center cut, attaches armatures via screws. Experience - animation 1 -> made
romantic teddy bear stop motion. Inspirations: Chicken Run, Tim Burton films, Kubo
Youtube animations. Significance- Lyca Studios = dream job.
