#9/18 Presentation notes:
Daylin - 2-5 min short stop motion film. Teenage girl, city, relationship b/t
audience and characters in that time. Contrasting tones of blue/orange, dif
lighting, similar to Coraline. Stop motion puppets/set. Reading Stop-motion
Animation book, borrowed by M. Shroegen. Wood armature, clay hands w/epoxy putty,
foam head, bead eyes like Coraline. Armature wires. Skin - smooth, realistic.
Helped by sculptor/anatomy sister. Gowned woman, wandering city streets, blue lights,
warmer oranges rise from underneath, identical stop motion puppet greets her. She's
accepting a new rebirthed version of herself. Will document process. Wooden table,
center cut, attaches armatures via screws. Experience - animation 1 -> made
romantic teddy bear stop motion. Inspirations: Chicken Run, Tim Burton films, Kubo
YouTube animations. Significance- Lyca Studios = dream job.

Lindsay- Balley animation, no dialogue, plays to music. Dancer, ghost, bear. Cute.

Erika- Scary 2-5 min nightmare animation. Jurji Ito inspired. Tomie, Uzimaki,
Satoshi Kan. Birdboy. Lumpy Touch, Emily Carrol. Thinks I need to check out
##Gerald's Game.

Griztown- formerly StreetBrew, redesigned to be a user friendly way to map
local events. Events expire upon end-dates, keeps app up-to-date. Goals:
marketable app w/ mock ups. Fulfillment: learns how to make apple apps within
set criteria. Like Google, Instagram, Snapchat and more. Will advertise for
local businesses etc. Will start as a local app, prove concept before becoming
a global app. First Friday could be an example of an event to promote. Can plan
routes and times for visiting event.

Kaitlin- The Office of Dairy Queen.
