            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet2">I was initially going to make an animation and this website was centered around it. The project has changed and my main focus is this website and its design.</li>
            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet3">My work load entailed 3 stages of developement. Stage 1: the website started with blue html links and no css. Stage 2: a menu banner was added, it included css, but it was not scalable. Stage 3: the hamburger menu was added along with unique css and js. The website's new theme is based off of the success of the hamburger menu.</li>
            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet4">This website will serve as the formal presentation of any completed work.</li>
            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet5">The feedback for this website has been all positive. The website is constantly changing in order adjust to feedback.</li>
            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet6">I am happy with the hamburger menu and how it functions. My main reason for changing project direction is because I like debugging and problem solving - which is 90% of the process.</li>
            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet7">The website is always in progress. The design and organization are always changing. The content is always changing. There's always something to do.</li>
            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet8">I'm hoping that this is my last semester; but if it is not, I know that the website is going to be more polished and contain a lot more content by the end of next semester.</li>
