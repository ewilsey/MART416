            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet2">I was initially going to make an animation and this website was going to be centered around it. The project has now changed to this website and its design.</li>
            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet3">My work load entailed 3 stages of developement. Stage 1: the website started with blue html links and no css. Stage 2: a menu banner was added with css but it wasn't scalable. Stage 3: a hamburger menu was added with unique css. This menu contains js. It was so sucessful that the website's new theme is the hamburger.</li>
            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet4">This website will serve as the formal presentation of completed work.</li>
            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet5">All positive. The website was constantly changing so the majority of feedback was less recent.</li>
            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet6">I'm really happy with the hamburger menu and how versatile it is. I liked the debugging even though it takes the longest amount of time trying to figure out why something isn't working. </li>
            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet7">The website is always in progress. There's a lot to do.</li>
            <li id="bullet1" class="bullet8">I'm hoping this is my last semester but if it is not, I know that the website is going to be more polished and contain a lot more content.</li>
