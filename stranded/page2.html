      <h1>PAGE 2</h1>

Moonshine smacks Charlie in the back of the head. He snatches the
shotgun away.

                    MOONSHINE
          You two have to be the biggest
          fucking idiots that I have ever
          laid eyes upon. Slug or not, you're
          gonna blast Charlie's head off his
          shoulders. I can't be held responsible
          for that. Here, use this instead.

Moonshine whips around a lever action rifle slung to his back. He
spin-cocks it around old west style. He hands the rifle to Charlie.

                  CHARLIE
        Oh hells yeah. Good looking out my
        dude.

                  BRUCE
        Yeah, good looking out, dude.

                  CHARLIE
        Shut up out there and hold still.

Bruce fidgets with the can on top of his head.

                    BRUCE
          You shut up and hold still.

                    MOONSHINE
          Okay, Bruce. Don't fucking move
          unless you want a hole the size
          of a Buick where your eyebrows
          used to meet.

Moonshine gives Charlie a thumbs up. Moonshine plugs his ears.

Charlie lines up the shot.

Bruce plugs his ears, eyes close.

The beer can balances atop Bruce's head.

Charlie squeezes the trigger.

Bang!

The beer can explodes off of Bruce's head. Hillbilly Trio whoops,
hollars.

INT. Jeep

          You're gonna love it at my dad's
          place.
