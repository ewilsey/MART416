EXT. FOREST ROAD -- DAY

A back country road winds itself several times around a very
deep, tree dense ravine. Birds chirp in the treetops. Deer
graze roadside. It is majestic, calm.

A burly 4-door JEEP barrels down the road.

A DEER jumps out in front of the jeep. The Jeep swerves,
avoids deer.

INT. JEEP

STACY, a brilliant and sensitive bohemian goddess, plays on her phone in
the passenger seat. MARK, handsome -- but trying  a little too hard to be --
in designer jeans and shades, drives.

                    MARK
          Whoops.
                    STACY
          Slow down, Mark! You made me miss.
                    MARK
          Care to put down your phone and drive, Stacy?
                    STACY
          Ugh. You know I can't reach the pedals. Plus, I don't
          like driving stick when you're in the car.

Mark turns to Stacy and revs the engine.

EXT. CLIFFSIDE PULL OUT

The JEEP drives by to reveal a cliffside pull out where THREE DRUNK
MEN bullshit over the growing beer can mountain that ecumbers the
bed of an OLD BEATER TRUCK . Their names are MOONSHINE, BRUCE,
and CHARLIE. Similar in age, Charlie is the eldest at thirty-nine.
They are all certifiable idiots and yet somehow, Moonshine remains
the most sensible of the three.

                    BRUCE
          Hey Charlie, think you can hit this
          here can off my top like ol' William
          Tell?
                    Charlie
          Bruce, I dunno who the fuck that is; but hell
          yes, I will give it my most earnest try.
          Hand me that 12-guage!

Bruce hands Charlie the SHOTGUN.

Bruce jogs out to the edge of the cliffside pullout.
He lines the beer can up on top of his head.


Bruce gives Charlie a thumbs up.
