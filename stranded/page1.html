EXT. FOREST ROAD -- DAY

A back country road forks in two around a very
deep, tree dense ravine. Birds chirp in the treetops. Deer
graze roadside. It is majestic. It is calm.

A burly 4-door JEEP barrels down the road.

A DEER jumps out in front of the jeep. The Jeep swerves.

INT. JEEP

MARK, twenties, handsome -- but trying hard to be -- in
designer jeans and shades, drives. STACY, naturally beautiful,
bright eyes, adventerous personality, plays on her phone.

                    MARK
          Whoops.
                    STACY
          Slow down! You made me miss.
                    MARK
          Care to put down your phone and drive?
                    STACY
          Ugh. You know I can't reach the pedals. Plus, I don't
          like driving stick when you're in the car.

Mark turns to Stacy and revs the engine.

EXT. FURTHER UP THE ROAD

THREE DRUNK MEN bullshit over the growing beer can mountain
that ecumbers the bed of an OLD BEATER TRUCK. Their names are
MOONSHINE, BRUCE, and CHARLIE. Similar in age, Charlie is the eldest
at thirty-nine. They are all certifiable idiots and yet somehow,
Moonshine remains the most sensible of the three.

                    BRUCE
          Hey Charlie, think you can hit this
          here can off my top like ol' William
          Tell?
                    Charlie
          I dunno who the fuck that is; but hell
          yes, I will give it my most earnest try.
          Hand me that 12-guage!

Bruce hands Charlie the SHOTGUN. Bruce jogs several yards out and
lines the beer can up on top of his head.
