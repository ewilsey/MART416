      <h1>PAGE 4</h1>

Moonshine kneels down at his fallen comrade's side.

Charlie loads the rifle.

                    CHARLIE
          You sons of bitches!

Charlie aims his rifle at the Jeep.

INT. JEEP

                    MARK
          Shit, hang on.

Mark slams on the gas.

BANG

The back window shatters.

                    MARK
          Stacy, get down!

BANG -- BANG

                    STACY
          Oh God, please God.

Mark slumps in his seat. The accelerator jams.

The Jeep nears towards the sharp corner.

                    STACY
          Mark? Mark!



EXT. SHARP CORNER

The Jeep jerks hard right and slams against the guard rail

BAM

Stacy kicks the stick out of gear.

The engine high revs.

Stracy reaches for the wheel, over-corrects.

The Jeeps spins out of control hits the guard rail a second time and flips over
the guard rail.

Plummets. Crashes out of sight into the tree dense ravine.
