      <h1>PAGE 3</h1>

                    STACY
          I wish you would have told me that's what
          we were doing today. I don't want your
          parents' first impression of me to include
          this shirt.

                    MARK
          C'mon, I love you. You look fine.

                    STACY
          I love you, but I look like a slut.

                    MARK
          My dad's not gonna care. You're smart,
          that's the only thing he's going to
          notice about you.

EXT. CLIFFSIDE PULL OUT

Moonshine and Charlies celebrate. Moonshine sprays
a full can of beer on Charlie. Pull through to reveal.

Bruce wipes beer from his eyes. He pats himself down to
his crotch and back up to his mullet. Everything is still
there. He takes a step back towards the cliffside pull
out's edge.

The ground gives way to the weight of Bruce's foot.

Bruce tumbles backwards off the cliffside pull out edge.

Bruce lands on the FOREST ROAD below the Cliffside pull put.
He is in the path of the Jeep.

BAM!

The Jeep runs over Bruce. It screeches to a halt.

Bruce lays face down in the road. Blood pools beneath him.

INT. JEEP

Mark and Stacy look at each other and back at the body.

The Jeep's engine hums.

EXT. FOREST ROAD

Moonshine and Charlie clamber down the Cliffside to the Forest Road
where their friend lay.

                    MOONSHINE
          Bruce? Bruce! Oh God, what have they
          done to you.
