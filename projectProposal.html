      <h1> Web Development and Animation Proposal </h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>

        The goal of this project is twofold as it will showcase a proficiency
      in web development and animation to potential employers in these fields
      after graduation. The website used to host this project will be in itself,
      its own project. It will be created from the ground up using original code
      and maintained throughout the semester. The project inside of this website
      is an original, multi-medium animation about a woman's fight for survival.
      All development on this animated project will be documented and maintained
      here on this website.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        In 2014, I enrolled as a non-traditional freshman at the University
      of Montana. This two part project is a culmination of the last five
      years. It has been a long road and yet every up and down has lead to this
      exact moment. Animation was the initial end goal and the primary reason
      for enrolling in this program. Web development is just as creative and
      intensive as builing an animation. What started as a course requirement
      has turned into another avenue for potential employment.

      <h2>Description</h2>

          The web development portion of this project will be represented by
        this website and all content contained within. The style and
        organization will change over the course of this semester. The goal of
        this web development project is for this webisite to become the home for
        all of my future projects.

          The first project to be implemented into this website will be my
        animation, Stranded. Stranded is a short survival story about a woman
        who fights for her survival after a fatal altercation that leaves her
        boyfriend dead and her stranded in the middle of nowhere. 

      <h2>Potential Challanges and Problems</h2>

        Alot of people have criticized animation and web development for being
      too tedious and time consuming. 14 weeks is a short deadline to complete
      this project; it will be the ultimate test of time-management.
