      <h1> Web Development and Animation Proposal </h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>

        The goal of this project is twofold as it will showcase a proficiency
      in web development and animation to potential employers in these fields
      after graduation. The website used to host this project will be in itself,
      its own project. It will be created from the ground up using original code
      and maintained throughout the semester. The project inside of this website
      is an original, multi-medium animation about a woman's fight for survival.
      All development on this animated project will be documented and maintained
      here on this website.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>



      <h2>Description</h2>

        The web development portion of this project will be represented by
      this website and all content contained within. The style and
      organization will change over the course of this semester. The goal of
      this web development project is for this webisite to serve as the home
      for all of my future projects.

        The first project to be implemented into this website will be my
      animation, Stranded. Stranded is a short story about a woman
      who fights for her survival after a fatal altercation that leaves her
      boyfriend dead and her stranded in the middle of nowhere. The script
      was originally drafted last year and is currently in the process of
      editing and finalization. Once the script has been finalized, test
      images and storyboarding will begin. Animatics will come next and then
      the animation will be made. During the course of production, voice
      acting, sounds, and experimental music will be created. The final stage
      of production will include assembly, editing, and publishing the finish
      project on YouTube to be linked back here on this website.

      <h2>Significance</h2>

        In 2014, I enrolled as a non-traditional freshman at the University
      of Montana. This two part project is a culmination of the last five
      years. Animation was the initial end goal and the primary reason
      for enrolling in this program. Web development is just as creative and
      intensive as builing an animation. What started as a course requirement
      has turned into another avenue for potential employment.

      <h2>Related Works and Background</h2>

        The opening scene of Stranded will present the state of the world as it
      and reveal the inciting incident that changes everything. Stranded opens
      in a forest where birds are chirping in the trees and deer are peacefully
      grazing roadside. That is, until a Jeep comes barrelling down the road
      narrowly avoiding a deer that has wandered into its path. This is similar
      to the opening scene of Bambi and the introduction of the hunter who
      does unfortunately, kill Bambi's mother.

        The female protagonist of Stranded, Stacy, is the only
      survivor at the end of the story.This is similar to the final-female
      character in many horror films including Alien, Holloween, The Texas
      Chainsaw Massacre and many more.

        Mark suffers a plot-triggering death and therefore is the forgotten
      fallen friend because while the death and loss of Mark is traumatic for
      Stacy, the rest of the story is about her survival. The dwelling on the
      death of Mark comes after the events in the story and is not revisited.

        The script for Stranded was inspired by the films, The Bourne Supremacy
      and Jurassic Park. Intense action and drama occur when the Jeep spins out
      of control and dissapears into the ravine. The scenen in Bourne Supremacy
      when Marie dies while fleeing with Jason in a Jeep is the direct
      inspiration for that scene. The scene in Jurassic Park when the T-Rex
      tosses the Jeep off the road where it lands in a dense tree canopy is the
      direct inspiration for how and where the Jeep ends up after flipping over
      the rail in Stranded.

        Stranded is like a horror story because the bear encounter is a major
      point of terror. The bear evokes fear, repulsion, and is a nearly
      unstoppable force. Stacy is completely defenseless when the bear climbs
      the tree, opens the driver door and proceeds to eat Mark. Similar monsters
      in horror films include Jason in Friday the 13th and the velociraptors in
      Jurassic Park.

      <h2>Potential Challanges and Problems</h2>

        Alot of people have criticized animation and web development for being
      too tedious and time consuming. 14 weeks is a short deadline to complete
      this project; it will be the ultimate test of time-management.



      To do:

      	Proof-of-Concept Presentation / Pilot Study / Early Work
      	Work-plan and Deliverables
      	Conclusion
