      <h1>Abstract</h1>
        The goal of this project is twofold as it will showcase a proficiency
      in web development and animation to potential employers in these fields
      after graduation. The website used to host this project will be in itself,
      its own project. It will be created from the ground up using original code
      and maintained throughout the semester. The project inside of this website
      is an original, multi-medium animation about a woman's fight for survival.
      All development on this animated project will be documented and maintained
      here on this website.

        In 2014, I enrolled as a non-traditional freshman here at the University
      of Montana. This two part project is a culmination of the last five
      years. It has been a long road and yet every up and down has been leading
      to this exact moment.
