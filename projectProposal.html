      <h1> Web Development and Animation Proposal </h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>

        The goal of this project is to showcase a proficiency in web development
      and animation to potential employers after graduation. This website will
      represent half of this project proposal. It will be created in Atom and
      will be maintained by me throughout the semester with its own readme file.
      The other half of my project proposal will live on this website as an
      original, multi-medium animation, written and animated by me. The entire
      creation process from start to finish will be documented on its own readme
      file.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        Animation and Web Development are artforms. Seperate they function as
      their own entities, but together they form a simbiotic partnership.
      Creating a web page allows for a place to store animations, and animations
      are what will bring people to the website. What I am proposing is a
      website where artists can collaborate, store, show and sell their artwork.
      The first project on this website will be my animation, Stranded.

      <h2>Description</h2>

        The web development portion of this project will be represented by
      this website and all content contained within. The style and
      organization will change over the course of this semester. The goal for
      this semester is for this webisite to serve as the home for all of my
      future projects. The success in this project and in my Web Server Tech
      class will determine if I can implement this website to be used for
      a community of artists, not just myself.

        The first project to be implemented into this website will be my
      animation, Stranded. Stranded is a short story about a woman
      who fights for her survival after a fatal altercation that leaves her
      boyfriend dead and her stranded in the middle of nowhere. The script
      was originally drafted last year and is currently in the process of
      editing and finalization. Once the script has been finalized, test
      images and storyboarding will begin. Animatics will come next and then
      the animation will be made. During the course of production, voice
      acting, sounds, and experimental music will be created. The final stage
      of production will include assembly, editing, and publishing the finish
      project on YouTube to be linked back here on this website.

      <h2>Significance</h2>

        This website will showcase my abilities as a web developer and designer.
      The animation will showcase my abilities as an artist, animator, editor,
      sound designer and script writer.

      <h2>Related Works and Background</h2>

        The opening scene of Stranded will present the state of the world as it
      and reveal the inciting incident that changes everything. Stranded opens
      in a forest where birds are chirping in the trees and deer are peacefully
      grazing roadside. That is, until a Jeep comes barrelling down the road
      narrowly avoiding a deer that has wandered into its path. This is similar
      to the opening scene of Bambi and the introduction of the hunter who
      does unfortunately, kill Bambi's mother.

        The female protagonist of Stranded, Stacy, is the only
      survivor at the end of the story.This is similar to the final-female
      character in many horror films including Alien, Holloween, The Texas
      Chainsaw Massacre and many more.

        Mark suffers a plot-triggering death and therefore is the forgotten
      fallen friend because while the death and loss of Mark is traumatic for
      Stacy, the rest of the story is about her survival. The dwelling on the
      death of Mark comes after the events in the story and is not revisited.

        The script for Stranded was inspired by the films, The Bourne Supremacy
      and Jurassic Park. Intense action and drama occur when the Jeep spins out
      of control and dissapears into the ravine. The scenen in Bourne Supremacy
      when Marie dies while fleeing with Jason in a Jeep is the direct
      inspiration for that scene. The scene in Jurassic Park when the T-Rex
      tosses the Jeep off the road where it lands in a dense tree canopy is the
      direct inspiration for how and where the Jeep ends up after flipping over
      the rail in Stranded.

        Stranded is like a horror story because the bear encounter is a major
      point of terror. The bear evokes fear, repulsion, and is nearly an
      unstoppable force. Stacy is completely defenseless when the bear climbs
      the tree, opens the driver door and proceeds to eat Mark. Similar monsters
      in horror films include Jason in Friday the 13th and the velociraptors in
      Jurassic Park.


      <h2>Potential Challanges and Problems</h2>

        Alot of people have criticized animation and web development for being
      too tedious and time consuming. 14 weeks is a short deadline to complete
      this project; it will be the ultimate test of time-management. I would
      like to see a finished product at the end of this semester.

        Another area of concern is in the character design. I have backgrounds
      and inanimate objects down, but human faces and certain other humanistic
      features are difficult for me to accurately represent to my level of
      satisfation. The only person animating this as of now, will be me. There
      are already areas of the script I am concerned with in terms of animation
      like when Stacy and Mark are riding in the Jeep, when Bruce falls off the
      edge, and when Stacy climbs down the tree. 

      <h2> Work Plan and Deliverables</h2>

        The script will be created first and as of now is already over halfway
      uploaded on this website with final edits. I should be able to finish
      uploading the rest of the script with final edits by this weekend.

        As soon as the script is done, background design is next. I have
      already taken some perspective photos for scenes. Those may or may not
      be available on this website today. I will start creating the scenes from
      these photos.

        After the scenery is drawn then character design will begin. There will be
      5 human characters in all, at least 2 deer, and one bear. There will be at
      least two vehicles, a Jeep and a truck. There will also be a series of
      props including a phone, 2 guns, and a mountain of beer cans.

        After character design will come the voice acting. I will try to voice
      the majority if not all 4 male characters. I might already have a female
      voice actor.

        After the characters are voiced, then story-boarding, animatics and
      animating begin. It may be done in sequential order or some scenes may be
      animated without storyboarding and so on. I anticipate this to be the
      most time consuming portion of the project so thouroughness will be
      dependant on timeline deadlines.

        When the animation is complete or in the process of coming to completion
      then sound design will begin. There will be birds chirping, engine noises,
      gunshots, rustling of leaves, gravel and so on.

        If there is time after general sound design then experimental music and
      other sounds will be added where necessary to drive the story forward or
      create tension where practical sounds did not.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        Having a website that houses my art projects in a controllable
      environment could be the stepping stone for creating a new website
      designed by artists for artists. This website will test and prove my
      abilities as a web developer. The Stranded animation will show that I am
      a serious artist and that I want to work for and collaborate with
      other artists. The projects work together because both are proof of
      concept of what this website and content can do.
