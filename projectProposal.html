      <h1> Web Development and Animation Proposal </h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>

        The goal of this project is to showcase a proficiency in web development
      to potential employers after graduation. This website will be created in
      Atom and maintained by me throughout the semester.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        Web Development is an artform, it can be functional as well as formal.
      The site itself is art, and what it is designed to display is more art. I
      envision this project website to eventually become a place where artists
      can come to collaborate, store, and showcase their art with me.

      <h2>Description</h2>

        My website and all of the content contained within during this semester
      are my sole creations. The style and organization will change over time.
      The goal for this semester is for this webisite to serve as the home for
      all of my future projects. The success in this project and in my Web
      Server Tech class will determine if I can implement this website to be
      used for a community of artists, not just myself.

      <h2>Significance</h2>

        This website will showcase my abilities as a web developer and designer.
      The contents held within will showcase my abilities as an artist,
      animator, editor, sound designer and script writer.

      <h2>Related Works and Background</h2>

        My website is similar to <h3>MORE HERE<h3>

      <h2>Potential Challanges and Problems</h2>

        Alot of people have criticized animation and web development for being
      too tedious and time consuming. 14 weeks is a short deadline to complete
      this project; it will be the ultimate test of time-management. I would
      like to see a working project by the end of this semester that satisfies
      my own contraints.

      A problem with creating a website on Atom this semester is that it will
      not have a database and <h3>MORE HERE<h3>

      <h2>Work Plan and Deliverables</h2>

      Time line: <h3>MORE HERE<h3>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        Having a website that houses my art projects in a controllable
      environment could be the stepping stone for creating a new website
      designed by artists for artists. This website will test and prove my
      abilities as a web developer. The content within will show that I am
      a serious artist and that I want to work for and collaborate with
      other artists. The project is a proof of concept of what this website and
      content can eventually become.
